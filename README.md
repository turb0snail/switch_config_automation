# Switch Config Automation

Switch Configuration Automation assists in automating the configuration process of network switches.

## Description

This repository contains scripts and tools for automating the tedious task of configuring network switches. With just a few commands, you can setup, modify, or delete configurations across one or multiple switches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Serial connection to the switches ( for now ;))

P.S: In all swithces while serial connection configuration firstly, you need to config the initial password for login. After then, you can prompt switch config automation with serial port. Last but not least after the configuration of the switches you should connect to the switch via serial connection check the configuration is written or not to the switch after all you must save the configuration manually. Lastly if you are running the script close all serial connections to the switch because serial port doesn't allow multiple connections. 

Hope this scripts will make your life easier ⚛️
